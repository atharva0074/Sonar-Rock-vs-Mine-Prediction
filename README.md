## Project Overview: Sonar Data Prediction
## Objective :
The goal of this project is to analyze sonar data and develop a predictive model to classify sonar readings as either a "Mine" (M) or "Rock" (R) using logistic regression.

## Dataset :
Source: The dataset consists of sonar readings, with 60 features representing various acoustic measurements and a target label indicating whether the object is a mine or a rock.
Columns:
Features (X): 60 continuous numerical values.
Target (Y): A categorical variable (M for Mine, R for Rock).

## Steps Involved:
# Data Collection and Processing:

The dataset is loaded using pandas and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed.
The shape of the dataset and descriptive statistics are displayed to understand the data distribution.
The target variable is examined for class distribution.

# Data Preparation:

The features (X) and labels (Y) are separated.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, ensuring stratification to maintain class proportions.

# Model Training:

A logistic regression model is initialized and trained using the training dataset.
The model learns to differentiate between the two classes based on the sonar readings.

# Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on both the training and testing datasets.
Predictions are made on the training data and testing data, and accuracy scores are printed.

# Making Predictions:

A new instance of sonar data is created to test the model's predictive capability.
The input data is reshaped and passed through the trained model to obtain a prediction.
The predicted class (Mine or Rock) is printed based on the model's output.

## Results:
The project outputs the accuracy of the model on both training and testing datasets, providing insights into its predictive capability.
The final prediction indicates whether the input sonar reading corresponds to a mine or a rock.

## Technologies Used :
Python Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations
pandas for data manipulation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning model building and evaluation

## Conclusion :
This project showcases the application of logistic regression for binary classification tasks using sonar data. The approach taken allows for understanding the underlying patterns in the data while providing a robust framework for making predictions. Further improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, using different models, or incorporating cross-validation for more reliable evaluation.
